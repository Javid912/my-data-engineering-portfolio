- I watched the video about how to become a DE, it was well made and brief, and I noticed I should maybe improve my SQL knowledge.. the main points were similar to what we were talking about in our first meeting with Filip 
- I've created the private repo as Filip requested and decided to really write every detail of what I am doing along the way
- doing a zhs setup ...
