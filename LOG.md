- On 22Nov23 I watched the video about how to become a DE, it was well made and brief, and I noticed I should maybe improve my SQL knowledge.. the main points were similar to what we were talking about in our first meeting with Filip 
I've created the private repo as Filip requested and decided to really write every detail of what I am doing along the way
doing a zhs setup..
