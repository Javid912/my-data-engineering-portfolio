- On 22Nov23 I watched the video about how to become a DE, it was well made and brief, and I noticed I should maybe improve my SQL knowledge.. the main points were similar to what we were talking about in our first meeting with Filip 
-I've created the private repo as Filip requested and decided to really write every detail of what I am doing along the way
-doing a zhs setup..

finally I got the oh-my-zsh] theme 'half-life-fpop'

Rancher Desktop is installed (allow max 4 GB memory and 2 CPUs, disable Kubernetes, use container engine moby, allow sudo access)
I've cloned the repo
 run a venv 
 I have added the docker-compose.yml from the airflow link
